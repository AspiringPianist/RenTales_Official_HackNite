## Problem Statement
Explain the problem statement here.

## Features
- RenTales allows users to generate a fully fledged visual novel by inputting a single prompt or story idea.
- View generated visual novels on our website.
- Context-Aware music and scene generation based on mood predicted by the BERT model.
- Automatic generation of character and background images based on the script.
- Play the generated visual novel through Ren'Py.
- Use of automatic1111's stable diffusion model for anime-style images.
- User-friendly interface with dialogues, character images, and backgrounds.
- Models used: Llama2:7b (base story idea) and tuned Llama2:7b for human-readable scripts.
- Script parser for .rpy script conversion.
- No need for API_TOKEN; everything runs offline.
- User-friendly GUI with animated loading screen using pygame and tkinter.
