Sure, here's a README section you can use on GitHub to compare the three outputs:

## Comparison of Model Outputs

This repository contains outputs generated by different models trained on various inputs. Here's a comparison of the outputs from three different models:

1. **Fine-tuned Model with that follows parsable format we require**
   
   This output was generated using a fine-tuned model with a specific prompt and tuning. The generated story is in the format required for our use case, including scenes, dialogues, narrator lines, and descriptions. The narrative structure is coherent and follows the provided prompt seamlessly, making it suitable for further processing and analysis.

   Example Scene:
   ```
   Scene 1 - The Journey Begins
   (Newline)
   Narrator: In the heart of the dense and mysterious Eldrador Forest, a group of close friends embarked on a camping trip, seeking solace and adventure in the untamed wilderness. (Insert newline)
   (Enter the group of friends, excited and eager for their adventure)
   Friend 1: Oh man, I can't wait to get away from the city and just relax in nature. This is going to be amazing!
   ```

2. **Only Prompted, Not Fine-tuned**
   
   This output was generated using a model without fine-tuning, only based on the provided prompt. While it follows the general structure of scenes, dialogues, and descriptions, the narrative lacks coherence and the format is not as consistent as the fine-tuned model output. Some parts may require manual editing or processing to fit the desired format.

   Example Scene:
   ```
   Scene 1 - Intro:
   (The camera pans over a dense and mysterious forest, before landing on a group of friends hiking through the underbrush.)
   Friend 1: (excitedly) I've been wanting to do this for ages! A camping trip in Eldrador Forest. It's like the ultimate adventure.
   ```

3. **No Fine-tune**
   
   This output was generated without a prompt or fine-tuning, resulting in a narrative that lacks structure and coherence. While it includes scenes, dialogues, and descriptions, the story's flow is disjointed, making it challenging to parse or use directly for our intended purpose without significant manual editing or post-processing.

   Example Scene:
   ```
   Scene 1 - The Discovery
   (Newline)
   Narrator: In the heart of a dense forest, a group of friends stumbled upon an abandoned village, shrouded in mystery and cursed by vengeful spirits. (Insert newline)
   (Enter the group of friends, cautiously approaching the village)
   Friend 1 : (excited) Wow, this place is creepy. Let's check it out. (Insert newline)
   ```

Overall, the fine-tuned model with a specific prompt and tuning produces the most suitable output for our use case, providing a structured narrative that aligns well with our project requirements.
