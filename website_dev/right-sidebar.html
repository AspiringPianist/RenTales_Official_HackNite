										<h2><a href="#">How It Works</a></h2>
										<p>
											Rentales generate Renpy executable scripts along with background, characters and music

											<h2>Model Utilization</h2>
										</header>
										<p>The process begins by selecting a base language model, specifically <strong>Llama2 7b</strong>, known for its capabilities in generating coherent text.We have modified the model to generate better stories for the same prompt.
										</p>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h2>Story Generation</h2>
										</header>
										<p><strong>Prompt-based Story Generation</strong>: The modified model is utilized to generate stories based on specific prompts provided by the user. These prompts serve as starting points for the model to create narrative content.</p><p>
											<strong>Comparative Analysis</strong>:
											We have tuned the model to generate better stories.
											Generated stories are compared with those produced by other models of similar parameters by passing same prompts.
											This step ensures that the modified model is indeed generating better quality narratives compared to its
											counterparts.
										</p>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h2>Text Processing and Parsing</h2>
										</header>
										<p><strong>Character Contexts and Scenes</strong>: The generated stories are processed to extract characters, contexts, and scenes. This involves analyzing the text to identify characters, their interactions, and the settings in which the story unfolds.</p>
										
									</section>
									<header>
										<h2>Sentiment-Analysis Music Settings</h2>
									</header>
									<p><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Another model analyzes every scene of the story and rates it based on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being negative and 5 being positive). Based on these ratings, our script selects suitable music for each scene.<br></p>
									<p>If continuous scenes follow around the same rating, the music doesn't change to <strong>maintain a flow</strong>.</p>
									</section>
									

								</section>
								<header>
									<h2>Character Generation</h2>
								</header>
								<p><strong>Contextual Prompts Generation</strong>: The characters extracted from the stories are then fed into an AI-powered prompter. This prompter generates contextual prompts for each character, providing guidance for their development and interactions within the narrative.
</p><p><strong>Background Prompts:</strong> Additionally, prompts for backgrounds and settings are generated to enrich the storytelling environment. These prompts help set the scene and create a vivid backdrop for the characters' interactions.
</p><strong>Prompt Refinement:</strong> The generated prompts undergo a refinement process to ensure coherence and relevance to the story. This involved manual adjustments or feedback loops with the prompt generation model to fine-tune the prompts for optimal storytelling.

								<h2>
									Ren'Py Script Conversion:</h2>
								</header>
								<strong>
									<p>
Script Formatting</strong> Once the narrative is generated, a script conversion tool formats the text into a Ren'Py runnable format. This format includes all necessary elements such as characters, backgrounds, dialogues, and cues for music and sound effects.
									</p><p><strong>Integration of Generated Content</strong>: The tool seamlessly integrates the AI-generated characters, backgrounds, and dialogues into the Ren'Py script, ensuring that the narrative is ready for interactive visual novel gameplay.
Quality Assurance: Before deployment, the Ren'Py script undergoes thorough quality assurance testing to ensure that all elements are correctly integrated and the narrative flows smoothly during gameplay.

		<h2>
		How Can This Be Useful?
		</h2>
	</header>
	<p><strong>Interesting Learning</strong>: 
	This application of AI can make the learning process more interesting. Instead of reading dry subject matter, we can use
	the power of AI to generate a story and present the story as an interesting way to learn the subject. 
	Instead of reading dry subject matter or a summary of the matter, we can see a visual representaion of the subject,
	helping us visualize and grasp data better.
	</p>

	<p><strong>Game Development</strong>: 
		The core of any game is its story and how engaging it is. Game development is a heavy process.
		To test a storyline for a game, it would be far easier and more efficient to test it in RenPy software rather than 
		testing it in the actual game. In this way, we can save time, conserve resources, select good storylines and most
		importantly money.
	</p>

	<p><strong>Personal Entertainment</strong>: 
		Individuals who enjoy visual novels but lack the time or creative energy to develop their own stories can use
		this tool to create personalized visual novel experiences based on their own prompts and preferences.
	</p>

	<p><strong>Personalized Advertisement</strong>: 
		Online advertisement in its current state serves the same ad but to the people who are interested or more likely 
		to become customers. But the inefficiency here is that the same ad is shown to all these people. With RenTales,
		we can create a personalised ad for a specific person with the data collected about him or her. In this way, 
		that person can relate to the ad in a personal way and are more likely to convert to customers.

									</header>
									<p>Ren'Py is a free and open-source visual novel engine used for creating interactive storytelling experiences. It simplifies the process of developing visual novels by providing a scripting language, a comprehensive set of tools, and a framework tailored specifically for creating narrative-driven games with text, images, and sound.
